# Blackjack
## A simplified version of the *Blackjack* game at casinos
- This application is named as Blackjack. It is literally a simplified version of Blackjack game which simulates
the classic casino banking game **without the splitting practice**. 
- The user will play the role of ***player*** and the program will play the role of ***dealer***. Any user looking for simulated gambling will play this game. 
- I find this application interesting because this game is more complex than a blog program and the GUI design for card game is practical for my 
current knowledge of Java.Swing. I personally also like playing Blackjack game.
